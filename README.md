### Readable App

This app was built as part of my React NanoDegree course from Udacity.

## Prerequisites

It requires [this API server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git)
to work.

```
> cd api-server; npm install
> npm start
Server listening on port 3001, Ctrl+C to stop
```

## To run

$ git clone https://github.com/andrecoghi/readable-app.git

```
> cd readable-app; npm install
> npm start
This will open app in http://localhost:3000
```

## Libraries used

The project uses the following dependencies:

* React
* Redux
* Redux Thunk
* React Router V4
* UUID
